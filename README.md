**Build reactive and scalable microservices using the Reactor framework**

## What is this book about?
Reactor is an implementation of the Java 9 Reactive Streams specification, an API for asynchronous data processing. This specification is based on a reactive programming paradigm, enabling developers to build enterprise-grade, robust applications with reduced complexity and in less time. Hands-On Reactive Programming with Reactor shows you how Reactor works, as well as how to use it to develop reactive applications in Java.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore benefits of the Reactive paradigm and the Reactive Streams API 
* Discover the impact of Flux and Mono implications in Reactor 
* Expand and repeat data in stream processing 
* Get to grips with various types of processors and choose the best one 
* Understand how to map errors to make corrections easier 
* Create robust tests using testing utilities offered by Reactor 
* Find the best way to schedule the execution of code
